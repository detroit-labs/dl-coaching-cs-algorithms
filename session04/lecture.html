Design an algorithm that runs in \(O(n \log n)\) to partition \(2n\)
numbers into \(n\) pairs such that the partition minimizes the maximum
of the pair.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
(1, 3, 5, 9) = ((1,3),(5,9)), ((1,5),(3,9)) or ((1,9),(3,5)).

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Why is it that computer science people won't shut up about sorting?
Well for one, computers spend a lot of time sorting. This was
measured back in the day on mainframes and about 25% of the
computing power was spent on sorting. Because of its prevalence,
sorting is the best-studied problem in computer science, so there is
an abundance of material, and a huge number of the most interesting
algorithm concepts can be applied to sorting, so it's a great lens
to look at algorithmic thinking through.

<h3 id="org4618e49">Efficiency</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
One of the reasons sorting is so important, is that once an order
is established, many other problems become easy.
</p>

<p>
Using O(n log n) algorithms leads to sub-quadratic algorithms for
these problems. Large-scale data processing simply cannot be done
sorting at &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>). An n<sup>2</sup>/4 algorithm will still take 250 billion
operations for 1 million items, while n log n takes a measly 13.8
million.

Explicitly controlling the order of keys is the job of a comparison
function. These are applied to pairs of elements to determine how
they are ordered.

</aside>
<p>
Comparison functions determine the rules for ordering.

"Alphabetizing" is the sorting function of strings.

Software libraries have complex rules for ordering all kinds of
types, including collations of characters.

<p>
In every day practice, we shouldn't be writing our own sorting
algorithms. Every reasonable programming language should have built
in sort and search routines. The built-in sorting algorithms that
come with your language are likely optimized to work with the data
structures and object types.

<h3 id="org0a63953">Equality</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
What do you do with equal values? Equal elements end up bunched
together in any total ordering, but we may also be concerned with a
secondary characteristic of the value. If we're sorting numbers it
might not matter so much, but if we're sorting people by name, we
might compare their given names if their surnames are the same.
</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing</li>
<li>Secondary key</li>

</ul>

<p>
The worst-case scenario of Quicksort is when all elements are equal.

<section id="slide-org57d3925">
<h3 id="org57d3925">Selection Sort</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
You probably remember selection sort from earlier in the course, or
also when you learned about arrays and got "implement selection
sort" as your homework. It scans an array, repeatedly finding the
smallest element in the unsorted part and putting it in the first
unsorted position.
</p>

</aside>

<div class="figure">

This takes \(n \times (find + swap)\) operations

<section id="slide-org08aa54f">
<h3 id="org08aa54f">Which Data Structure?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A selection sort performed on a heap is a different algorithm,
known as heapsort. It is often important to ask if we can achieve
better performance by using a different data structure.
</p>

</aside>
<p>
Using arrays or unsorted lists makes "find" take \(O(n)\) and "swap"
takes \(O(1)\), making selection sort \(O(n^2)\)
</p>

<p>
Balanced trees and heaps support "find" in \(O(\log n)\). Can we sort
in \(O(n \log n)\)?
</p>

<p>
Balancing work between operations can achieve a performance benefit.

<h2 id="org7edb130">Priority Queues</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
If you'll remember, last week we brought up priority queues
briefly. A priority queue gives us a flexibility over sorting. We
can put items in them in an arbitrary order, and it is more
cost-effective to insert items into a priority queue than to
re-sort the collection on each new arrival.
</p>

</aside>

<ul>
<li>\(insert(q, x)\): Given an item \(x\) with key \(k\), insert into queue \(q\)</li>
<li>\(find-min(q)\): Return item whose value is smaller than others in \(q\)</li>
<li>\(delete-min(q)\): Delete item from \(q\) whose key is minimum in \(q\)</li>

</ul>

<p>
All of these operations can be implemented with a heap or balanced
binary tree in \(O(\log n)\)
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org4af9fb9">
<h3 id="org4af9fb9">Preferences</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
One way we could use a priority queue is to suggest preferences
based on desirability.
</p>

</aside>

<ul>
<li>Retrieve items by desirability, not by name</li>
<li>Desirability changes, so re-insert the max value with a new score
after each encounter</li>
<li>New items can be inserted with perceived desirability</li>
<li>No reason to delete except from top</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgd1a605e">
<h3 id="orgd1a605e">Discrete Event Simulations</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We could also use priority queues for any kind of time-based
simulation. Stack and queue orders are just special cases of
orderings. In real life, people cut in line or break traffic laws,
and we can use a priority queue to model such behavior.

<h2 id="org67cb5b9">Heaps</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So, This whole time I've been talking about heaps, but if you
haven't read the reading material for this session yet you're
probably wondering what exactly a heap is. Heaps maintain partial
ordering. This weaker ordering than sorted order, but it's stronger
than random. However, we can always find the largest (or smallest,
for a min-heap) element in O(1), and we can maintain our heap for
inserts and deletes in O(log n)
</p>

</aside>
<p>
A binary heap is a form of binary tree, in which:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the tree is always filled except the bottom level</li>
<li>the root node is &ge; all of its children</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="orge40fa41">Heapsort</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So, let's take a look at how heapsort works. Notice as we go that
the partial sorting makes this easier to build than balanced binary
tree we did last week. If we get particularly lucky, this whole
thing can happen in linear time.

<h3 id="org635ccda">Implementing heaps</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Naturally, we might tend to want to represent a heap with a linked
tree structure, with pointers to lower elements. However, we can
store a tree as an array of keys, using the position of the keys to
implicitly satisfy the role of pointers. This tactic lets us create
a heap in O(n log n) by insertion.
</p>

</aside>

<p>
Arrays can implement the heap with the following
</p>

<ul>
<li>Left child of \(k\) sits in position \(2k\) and right is in \(2k + 1\)</li>
<li>The parent of \(k\) is at \(k \over 2\)</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org42005b1">Implicit Representation</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
This implicit representation of a heap is only beneficial when the
tree isn't full or "sparse". If there are holes in the tree
structure, we would need to navigate around them, which is why we
insist on always placing in the bottom-left available space, which
lines up with filling our array representation linearly.

Building a heap by merging ends up being faster than \(O(n \log n)\)
since most heaps we merge will tend to be small.

This works similarly to the convergence for dynamic arrays we
