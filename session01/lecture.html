<p>
These are the first 4 words of our book. Before we jump in too
far, I want to pose this question to all of you: what is an
algorithm?

<h3 id="orge918998">What is an Algorithm?</h3>

<p>
"An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task." or
more broadly, it's a way of describing a process for solving a
specific problem. Thus, an algorithm will be the same whether
programs implementing it are running in Fortran on a mainframe or
in ruby on a web server or in Swift on an iPad.

Skiena also tells us that to be "interesting", an algorithm should
do the following

<p>
It is fundamental to understand the difference between a general,
well-specified problem and an instance of that problem.

<h3 id="orgc6ebbce">Rigorous Specification</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So what does a rigorously specified problem look like? There is no
official format, but a formal statement might look something like
this
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
An instance of sorting might be an array of names, or a list of numbers.
Determining the general problem from an instance of a problem is
the first step in solving it.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
A faster algorithm running on a slower machine will always win for
sufficiently large instances of that problem. Often the instance
needn't even get very large before the faster algorithm wins. Thus
the lie of "it's fast enough" that we tell ourselves is always false.

Input:   A sequence of \(n\) keys \(a_1 \rightarrow a_n\)<br />

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So, an algorithm is a procedure that takes any possible input
instance and transforms it to be the appropriate desired
output. Often, there are innumerable ways of solving any particular
problem, and sorting is no exception.
&#x2014;
Insertion sort starts with one element (which is itself, a sorted
list) and then incrementally inserts the remaining elements such
that the list remains sorted.

<h3 id="orgb04eb49">Insertion Sort in C</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Insertion sort is a generalized algorithm. It works with any data
that the comparison operation for sorting works on. Thus, it will
work just as well on numbers, strings, or any other data for which
we have defined an ordered comparison. We can easily verify that it
is correct no matter the input.
&#x2014;
We want algorithms that are correct, efficient, and easy to
implement. Sometimes, we can't get all of these at the same
time. In practice, we will come up with a solution that is "good
enough" regardless of whether a better algorithm exists, and only
occasionally be faced with finding the most efficient solution once
there are serious performance issues - a situation this course
intends to prepare you for.
&#x2014;
For now though, we will focus on finding solutions that are
correct, which will be complicated enough. Let's take a look at
some problems and finding the correct solution, as opposed to just
a good solution.

So, one thing Rok is nice enough to do for us is to deliver mail to
our desks when it comes in. However, Rok's time is precious, so we
want to figure out a the shortest route for her to deliver the mail
as quickly as possible around the office. What would be a good place
to start with writing an algorithm to find the best way for Rok to
deliver the mail?

Input: A set of points \(P\) of size \(n\) for which the distance between the points is known<br />

<h3 id="org41099c9">Nearest Neighbor</h3>

<p>
Nearest Neighbor is common answer to this question. Pick some
point, and then take the distance to the point with the least cost
associated (the nearest), then repeat from the new point, until all
points are visited.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Nearest neighbor seems like a great way to solve our problem. It is
easy to think about, and it's easy to write the code. It just makes
sense to visit all the close places and then go to the farther away
points, and for the route we just saw it's reasonably efficient,
however it is utterly wrong for the problem we just stated.

<h3 id="org14ce856">Rok's Mail Route, Round 2</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Here is a configuration of desks for which the nearest neighbor
algorithm is one of the worst case scenarios! Rok would start with
Dan and Paul's desks, but then cross back to Brian's, and then
Nathan's, and so forth, wasting as much travel time as possible!
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Clearly starting at one end of this configuration and going
directly to the other would then make nearest neighbor work for
this instance, but rearranging the points again into a vertical
plane breaks this strategy yet again!
</p>

<section id="slide-org702e24c">
<h3 id="org702e24c">Closest Pair</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We could try another strategy. We could repeatedly connect the
closest pair of endpoints whose connection won't create a cycle (a
loop) or a 3-way branch of some kind. Each point will start as a
1-point chain. We'll go step by step with a set of either single-
or multiple-point chains, merging the points into the chain with
the closest endpoint and eventually have one big long chain, then
ends of which complete the cycle.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
This heuristic is more complicated and less efficient since we need
to do many more comparisons, but it does at least give the right
answer for the examples so far. So naturally, let's take a look at
another potential input that breaks it.
</p>

&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Connect \((x_m, y_m)\) by an edge<br />

<aside class="notes">
<p>
This configuration of desks doesn't work with closest pair
either. It would have Rok zig-zagging back and forth between the
rows of desks. In fact, if we moved the desks just close enough to
one another that the horizontal distance is just trivially large
enough to cause the zig-zag instead of completing them in a circle,
we're still walking about 20% more than just going around them.

<p>
Have you thrown your hands in the air in frustration yet? You're
probably wondering by now what the correct answer is, so here it
is. The only correct solution to this problem is to evaluate every
possible ordering of the points for the shortest path. By comparing
every possible combination we are guaranteed to end up with the
shortest route. However, this is ridiculously slow. As soon as you
have more than a handful of points, the fastest computers available
to you wouldn't be able to solve this problem in a reasonable
time.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Let's take a look at another problem and try to reason about it
in an algorithmic way. Imagine we have a number of possible jobs we
can assign a particular team to in the coming year. Each of these
jobs has a specific start and end day and the team can only be on
one project at a time. Each of these jobs pays the same amount.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
The goal of the business team is as usual: they want to assign the
team in a way to make as much money as possible. Because they each
pay the same amount, the goal will be to assign the team to the
maximum number of jobs such that no jobs conflict or
overlap. Looking at the picture we can see that the best option is
to assign them to 4 jobs, Pizza Frens, CrabCo and Casino folks, as
well as either Sammiches to Go or More Cars, LLC.

What about the earliest job? If we're not doing anything else, does it
make sense to just take the first thing that comes up?

<p>
&#x2014;

<p>
Taking work when there is no work makes sense, but we can easily
think up a data set for which this does not produce the desired
output, such as one very long job that starts before a series of
many shorter jobs that do not overlap.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;

<p>
Does this give you any ideas for another strategy? If longer jobs
starting early block later, smaller jobs, should we go by short
jobs instead?

Doing the most jobs naturally lends itself to taking the shortest
jobs possible, right? This seems to make sense until we once again
realize that we can create a data set wherein short jobs overlap
only the small gaps between several other large jobs that start
before and end after them. Thus, the shortest jobs may block work
on other jobs.

<p>
So, is the exhaustive search the only algorithm that is ever going
to work for solving problems? We know that "try all the
possibilities and select the best result" will always provide the
best result but that it's slow. We can see there that there are 2
to the power of n subsets, which is better than n factorial like in
the robot problem, but that's still a million subsets for n=20, but
at 100 jobs, we're in the ballpark of a 30-digit number of subsets
to generate. However, unlike the mail route problem, we can
actually solve the scheduling problem without doing an exhaustive
search.

For both of our problems today, we examined possible solutions to
our problems by finding counterexamples to our data
sets. Basically, we kept making data sets that break the previous
algorithm until we can't break it anymore. The idea is to
iteratively demonstrate the incorrectness of a heuristic until we
can't find an incorrect one.

incorrectness on. Then, think of all the possible combinations of
that small number. If a heuristic has words like "closest" or
"shortest", try to find weaknesses, like making things equally
close, or equally short. Also, try combining things extreme
examples. Try very close with very far away, or very short with
very long.

assume the rest is true all the way through n-1.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So far, we know that we can approach solving problems by honing our
intuition with examples and counter-examples, narrow down to a
heuristic, and then try to prove our heuristic by
induction. However, a lot of problems have already been solved in
computer science, and there's no reason we shouldn't rely on those
solutions to make our programs better. However, we will have
real-world data, and our algorithms work on abstract
structures. So, it's best for us to get good at modeling our data
and problem abstractly so that we can match them up with common
problems.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Permutations are good for arrangements and orderings. Keywords to
look for are "arrangement", "ordering", "sequence", or "tour".
</p>

<p>
Subsets are for selecting thing. This is often a strategy when we
need a "collection", "group" or "selection".
</p>

<p>
Trees give us hierarchies. This is usually our model when we want a
"hierarchy", "taxonomy", "history", or "inheritance".
</p>

<p>
Graphs are arbitrary relationships between objects. We're looking
at problems for "network", "circuit" or "relationship" here.
</p>

<p>
Points are used to model some data geographically. They come up in
problems around "location", "position" or "distance".
</p>

<p>
Polygons are used for space and geometry problems. Watch out for
"shapes", "regions", "configurations" and "boundaries".
</p>

<p>
Strings are obviously sequences of characters or
patterns. Obviously here we're looking at "text" or "label"
problems, but also pattern recognition.
</p>

<p>
You can find descriptions of how to think about these objects
recursively at the end of the first chapter.

<p>
So far, we've talked a lot about problems and how to think about
solutions to those problems. However, so far all we've said is that
one solution is "better" than the other because we had some
reasoning around it. If we're going to keep talking about why some
heuristics are better than others, we're going to need to establish
some ways of talking about, qualifying and quantifying them. That's
what we'll be establishing for the rest of this session.

Even though computers get faster and faster, algorithms remain

We almost always are concerned with the worst-case
scenario. Generally, things like the best-case scenario aren't
particularly interesting. We know the best-case scenario buying a
lottery ticket, but you'd probably be much more interested in
hearing about whether the worst-case scenario is one in a million
or one in ten. Algorithms incorporating randomness are becoming
more relevant with advances in computing, and average-case analysis
is required to show off their advantages, but for many other
algorithms, the average case simply reflects the worst case.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
It's important to note that these time complexities actually
represent numerical functions. However, they are too complex, so by
combining the RAM model with these analyses we come to Big-O
notation, which allows us to express complexity as a function
abstracted around the steps it takes.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Actual analysis of instances of algorithms is problematic as they
are both bumpy (too many corner cases) and require too much detail
to specify. Big-O simplifies analysis by ignoring unimportant
details and focusing on the bounding functions that have the
greatest impact on comparing algorithms. This includes ignoring
multiplicative constants and focusing on the variables that most
effect the complexity.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
How can we just toss out the constants and even the smaller
exponential factors? Well, as our values of n grow, the largest
exponential factor will always dominate the lower factors
significantly. Asymptotic dominance matters because although we may
think an algorithm runs "fast enough" for small cases, it will
inevitably hit a problem large enough that the time becomes
exponentially slow, so we should always seek an algorithm with
better complexity if such a solution is available.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
When was the last time you even saw the word logarithm in print or
on a screen? Likely it's been since your last math class. So,
Here's a refresher:
</p>

<p>
A logarithm is an inverse exponential function. When dealing with
powers of 2, logarithms reflect how many times we can multiply
something by 2 to reach some number, or how many time we can divide
that number by 2 to reach 1. However, as we'll see in a minute, the
base of the logarithm is actually unimportant for our needs, so
this works with powers of 3 or 5 or 10 or whatever.
</p>

<p>
So if logarithms are an inverse of exponential functions, and
exponential functions grow at an extremely fast rate as n gets
larger, then logarithmic functions actually grow slower and slower
as n gets larger. This makes sense when we take the nature of
logarithms into account, as they show up when we repeatedly halve
our data sets.

Here's another classic logarithm example:

<p>
A height h tree with d children per node has d<sup>h</sup> leaves.
</p>

<p>
For n leaves, n = d<sup>h</sup>, which implies h = log<sub>d</sub> n.
</p>

<p>
So, in a binary tree, n = 2<sup>h</sup>, so h = log<sub>2</sub> n
</p>

</aside>

In a tree with \(n\) leaves, how tall is the tree?

The number of leaves doubles with each level, so how many times can
we double 1 until we get to \(n\)?

<h3 id="org043e736">Bases and asymptotic dominance</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Lastly, I want to point out that we often don't write the base when
we're talking about logarithms in Big-O notation, and there is a
reason for that. Normally we just say that it is "log of n" without
stating something like "log sub 2 of n" and that's because the
actual base of the logarithm is relatively unimportant so long as
the algorithm is correct. Much like constants, the base can effect
the specific rate of growth, but asymptotically, O(log n)
algorithms will always grow faster than constant functions (which
do not grow) and slower than all other functions. We can find the
proof of this in the formula for changing the base of a log.
