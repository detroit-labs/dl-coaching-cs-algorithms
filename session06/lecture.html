<aside class="notes">
<p>
Can we sort in o(n log n)? If you'll recall, Big-O states there must
a bounding function that creates an upper bound of the function we
are analyzing for part of the range of the function. Little-O states
there must be a bounding function that creates an upper bound of the
function we are analyzing for ALL of the range of the function.
</p>

<p>
Now, when we write a sorting algorithm, we are essentially
committing to some decision tree. Given the same data, that decision
tree will make the same comparisons based on the provided
decisions. However, given different data, it will use different
comparisons. but the decisions themselves will not have changed.
</p>

<p>
So what are we saying when we ask "can we sort in little-o n log n?"
</p>

<p>
We want to know if we can always do better than O(n log n), and
never do anything worse than O(n log n), so never O(n<sup>2</sup>) or greater.

It's important to note here that we're not strictly doing primitive
binary sorting of the "does A go before B or does B go before
A". If we can find the correct pile in constant time and each pile
gets O(1) cards, this will happen in O(n) time.

merging, or \(O(1)\).

Radix sort is another non-comparison sort that works on

<p>
You are given \(n\) bolts of different sizes and \(n\) corresponding
nuts. Trying a nut on a bolt tells you whether they are too big, too
small, or a good fit. Differences between pairs are
indistinguishable without testing, so you cannot compare 2 bolts or
2 nuts. Match each bolt to each nut.

Highways between cities are almost always undirected because
highways almost always go both ways.

<p>
Street networks in a city are directed due to one-way streets, road
closures etc.

Most of the interesting problems in graph theory are related to
undirected graphs. Due to the nature of directed graphs, there are
fewer interesting choices to make.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In an <i>unweighted</i> graph, there is no cost difference between the
edges and vertices, and each is treated equally.
</p>

<p>
In a road network, the edges representing the roads might be
weighted by their length, drive time, or speed limit.
</p>

<p>
In a circuit, the weight might be voltage or resistance.
</p>

</aside>
<p>
In a <i>weighted</i> graph, each edge or vertex has a <i>weight</i> associated
with it, usually a numerical value.

<p>
A <i>simple</i> graph is the kind of graph you probably picture in your
mind when you think about vertices connected by edges, with edges
going between different vertices.
</p>

<p>
Certain types of edges make a graph no longer simple. A self-loop
where an edge has the same vertex at one end is one such case. A
multi-edge is an edge that occurs more than one, and is another
case. Graphs containing these are not considered simple.

If a graph has few of the possible connections between vertices as
actual edges, we call it a <i>sparse</i> graph. A <i>dense</i> graph usually
has in the neighborhood of \(n^2\) edges.

Roads are generally sparse graphs due to the physical constraints
of space, while a tightly-knit friend group on social media might
be rather dense.

A cycle is a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is
reachable from itself. So, a graph that creates any kind of closed
loop is cyclic.
</p>

<p>
Graphs that do not create cycles are called acyclic. A connected,
undirected graph with no cycles is a tree. Directed acyclic graphs
or DAGs show up often as decision flowcharts or in scheduling problems.

<p>
One of the most important operations is traversing every edge and
vertex. We need this so be systematic so that we don't miss
anything, and we want to visit each edge the fewest number of
times, twice at the most.

A maze is essentially a graph, so any algorithm suitable for
traversing a graph should be powerful enough to enable us to get
out of an arbitrary maze.

<h3 id="orgdddc91c">Marking</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To be both efficient and correct, we will need a way of thinking
about how to traverse the graph as well as abstract around the
state of our traversal. For this we can use the concept of marking.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
A vertex cannot be processed before we are aware it exists. As we
discover new vertices, we can take a look at their edges and begin
to follow them to discover more vertices. Once all of a vertex's
edges have been visited, we can consider that vertex processed.
</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li><i>undiscovered</i>: not yet seen</li>
<li><i>discovered</i>: have visited, but haven't visited all edges</li>
<li><i>processed</i>: have visited vertex and all incident edges</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgb1dc142">
<h3 id="orgb1dc142">Discovery Queue</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To facilitate this, we will need to maintain some data structure
containing the vertices we have discovered by not fully
explored. For any vertex in the queue, we examine every edge
incident to it, and for each edge that goes to an undiscovered
vertex, we mark it ass discovered and add it to the queue. No
matter the order we explore the vertices, each edge should only be
considered twice, as each of its vertices are explored.
</p>

<p>
In this way, every edge and vertex in the connected component of
the graph is visited eventually. If there are unvisited vertices
whose neighbor gets visited, we will eventually visit them via
their neighbors.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
As we stated before, one of the main things we want to do with
graphs is to systematically traverse the graph until every vertex
and edge has been visited exactly once, and hopefully in some
semblance of order. One of those strategies of order is Breadth
First Search. Breadth-first search is the most appropriate traversal
method if we're interested in the shortest paths on unweighted graphs.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
One way of structuring the data required for a breadth first search
is to keep a pair of boolean arrays for our mark states, as well as
one of integers, which we'll use to store the indices of the parent
node in our search. So, whatever node we visit at some index <i>i</i>
will have its parent's index stored at parent[i]

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In BFS, vertices are discovered in an order such that each
iteration is discovering points further away from the root of the
search. The unique path from the root to any node in the graph uses
the smallest possible number of edges on any root-to-node path in
the graph.

<h3 id="org7153d9b">Connected Components</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Connected components in undirected graphs represent the different
pieces of the graph.
</p>

<p>
Many problems can be solved by modeling them this way. There is a
graph of possible moves from the way a Rubik's cube is currently
configured to it's completed state. Likewise, there is a graph of
possible moves in a sliding puzzle its current layout to the
finished one.
</p>

<p>
However, breadth-first search only covers the connected component
that the root of our search is in. If we cannot find the node we
are looking for or haven't discovered all the nodes, we may need to
run BFS again on an undiscovered component to find the remaining
nodes.

<h3 id="org8e1d304">Coloring Graphs</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Vertex coloring is used to label ("color") vertices in the graph so
that edges never link two vertices of the same color.
</p>

<p>
A "Bipartite" graph is a colored graph such that it can be colored
without conflicts using only two colors. These show up in a lot of
kinds of problems naturally, but have become even more common with
the rise of social media platforms, as they are very useful in
social network analysis.
</p>

<p>
For example you might imagine some set of nodes on one side of a
graph that are the "user" nodes and one set of nodes on the other
side that are the "interest" nodes. Users will have edges
connecting them to interests, and likewise, we can walk other edges
from an interest node to find other users who are also interested
in the same thing.
