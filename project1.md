Project 1
=========

This project involves implementing algorithms to solve programming
challenges. The goal is to test your newly gained algorithmic analysis
skills. These may be implemented in any language you choose, and are
intended to be completed as a group.

Directions
----------

For each of the following challenges, examine the problem, input and
expected output. Then, devise an algorithm to solve the problem. Write
a short summary of your intended algorithm describing how it is
intended to function and the expected and worst-case complexities,
with pseudocode if applicable. Lastly, write an implementation of the
challenge in your preferred language. Once you have completed your
implementation and verified that it works correctly, analyze your
implementation to approximate the number of operations it uses.
