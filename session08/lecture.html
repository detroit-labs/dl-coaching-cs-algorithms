<p>
With breadth-first and depth-first searches, we have been largely
concerned with graphs where all of the edges connecting vertices
were of equal relevance. This week, we're going to start exploring
edge-weighted graphs, where edges connected vertices have an
associated weight or cost.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
A spanning tree is a subgraph of some graph G such that it
has the same set of vertices as G, but is also a tree - that is, a
graph with no cycles.
</p>

<p>
A minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph is a spanning tree of
the graph whose edges add up to the minimum weight. There can
multiple of these, as there are many situations where the sum of
the edge weights could be the same along multiple trees.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Minimum spanning trees show up in many graph applications. They've
also been around for a long time, dating back to 1926 for the first
algorithm for finding them. This charming fellow is Otakar Boruvka
and he was trying to figure out how to provide electricity to an
area called Malavia in the Czech Republic when he first discovered
an algorithm for finding MSTs. His works by looking at pairs of
vertices and finding the cheapest way to make them into groups,
then looking at those groups and finding the cheapest ways to
connect them, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Finding minimum spanning trees generally involves greedy
algorithms Â­ those that choose what to do next based on the best
local option from all available choices. Getting this to happen in
an efficient way involves using some clever data structures.
</p>

<p>
What are some applications where you might want to visit every
vertex in a graph while taking the minimum cost in edges?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing networks to use the least amount of physical connections</li>
<li>Finding clusters</li>
<li>Dividing graphs into partitions by deleting the longest edges
sequentially</li>
<li>For points in euclidean planes, MST is a good starter heuristic
for the traveling salesman problem</li>

<h2 id="orgfb8bbdc">Prim's Algorithm</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Prim's algorithm is another method of finding minimum spanning
trees. It starts at one vertex and grows the tree one edge at a
time, picking the cheapest edge that will not create a cycle.
</p>

<p>
How do we know this is giving us a spanning tree? Because we're
always trying to connect a new node, which is inherently a discovery
tree.

Let's give this thing a shot, starting from the vertex in the
lower-left corner.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
By now, you should probably agree that this is going to give us a
spanning tree. You should probably also agree that is going to give
us a MST with a relatively low weight. Do you think that this will
provide the lowest possible weight of any possible spanning tree on
a graph? Because it will.

be creating a cycle of any kind, but how will we know it is the

<p>

<p>
Given any graph, even if we would have to create a cycle to take
the least weighted edge, we can still delete a previous, heavier
edge to leave the graph connected an maintain connectivity in the
tree.

<h3 id="orgb3854f4">MST for Traveling Salesman</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
If you'll remember, Traveling Salesman asks us to visit some series
of points in a graph at minimum total cost. You may also remember
that this is a hard problem! There is no efficient general
algorithm to find the shortest around trip between vertices on a
graph! However, depth-first search and minimum spanning trees can
give us a rough starting point that is not more than twice the
optimum tour.
</p>

<p>
First, we find the minimum spanning tree. Then, we run DFS from an
arbitrary vertex (or a known starting vertex). This gives a
relatively good path to travel, if not the optimum path.

<h3 id="org3e5fa39">How Fast is Prim's?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Well, how fast Prim's algorithm is will depend on the data
structures used to implement it.
</p>

<p>
First off, it should be clear that we need at least n iterations,
one for each node that we're going to add to the tree. In each
vertex we need to find the edge with the minimum weight that goes
between a tree node and a non-tree node. What kind of data
structure could we use to do the minimum bookkeeping for this
algorithm? We could keep something like an n-sized bit vector to
accompany an adjacency list and keep track of whether or not it is
in the tree yet.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm as listed here happens in O(nm) time, by doing a DFS
or BFS to loop through all the edges and a total of n iterations.
</p>

<p>
What could we do to speed up the inner loop?
</p>

<h3 id="org4e938a4">Toward a faster Prim's</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
If we want to go faster, we're going to have to identify the fringe
vertices and the minimum cost associated with it quickly.
</p>

<p>
For every one of the fringe vertices, we can keep track of only the
cheapest edge that connects it to the tree. For this we would need
a data structure that keeps track of the cheapest edge (so far)
that links a particular edge back into the tree. If we had such a
data structure, we could then take the cheapest edge in that data
structure that connects a new vertex, and then update it with newly
possible vertices and their respective cheapest weights.

<section id="slide-org7445ac3">
<h3 id="org7445ac3">Prim's Analysis</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
What is the time it takes to find the minimum weight fringe edge?
This happens in O(n) because we need to iterate through our
distance collection to find the minimum.
</p>

<p>
After we add a new vertex to the tree, we'll need to run through
its adjacency list in O(n) time to check whether there are cheaper
ways to connect its neighbors to the tree. If so we'll need to
update the distance values.
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to make this faster with some other kind of data
structure aside from arrays? Not really, but this is the kind of
thing we want a heap for in general. You could probably come up
with something very specific that is heap-like.
</p>

<p>
Now the real question is&#x2026; can we beat Prim's algorithm on a dense
graph? Remember that a dense graph has in the neighborhood of n<sup>2</sup>
edges. Can we find the MST without looking at every edge? We
probably want to examine every edge in case one is comparatively
very, very cheap. So it's likely that Prim's is optimum for dense
graphs.
</p>

<p>
What kind of complexity would be good for sparse graphs? Would it be
a factor of the n vertices or of the m edges?

<h2 id="orgf709047">Kruskal's Algorithm</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Well, we know from Prim's that if the number of edges approaches n<sup>2</sup>
it probably doesn't make much different because the complexity of
the algorithm is independent of the edges. In the case of a sparse
graph, we can do better with Kruskal's algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Kruskal's Algorithm is also greedy, and it works by repeatedly
adding the smallest edge to the spanning tree which does not create
a cycle.

<h3 id="org178a037">Kruskal's always the minimum</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Much like Prim's Algorithm, here is another proof by contradiction.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
After all this, we can see that if we delete the new heavy edge, we
would have a better optimal tree, meaning the MST wasn't an MST,
thus Kruskal's must be correct.
</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li>Must be a graph \(G\) where Kruskal's doesn't produce MST</li>
<li>If so, must be an edge \((x,y)\) such that we cannot add to the MST</li>
<li>When we added \((x,y)\), there was no path from \(x\) to \(y\) we would
have a cycle. So adding \((x,y)\) now must create a cycle.</li>
<li>At least one edge must have been added after \((x,y)\) so it must
be heavier.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9561b51">
<h3 id="org9561b51">How fast is Kruskal's</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Here is perhaps the simplest representation of the implementation
of Kruskal's Algorithm
</p>

<p>
To test cycles we can use BFS or DFS to check for cycles, which
happens in O(n) time. The total time is therefore O(mn). Is this
really any better than Prim's? It looks clever, but the cycle
checking part is far too expensive to save much time over Prim's.
</p>

<p>
Do you think we can be more efficient than that? If so, we would
have to find a faster way of checking for cycles during the
BFS/DFS. To do that, we can keep track of what component a vertex
belongs to as we assemble the tree, and to do that, we can use the
Union-Find data structure described in the book that merges sets in
log n time.
</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li>Sort the \(m\) edges in \(O(m \log m)\)</li>
<li>&forall; edges, check for a cycle. If no cycle, add to forest.</li>

<section id="slide-org9ec07b2">
<h3 id="org9ec07b2">Union-Find</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Union-Find is a data structure for maintaining sets and if two
elements are the same, merge them together. We can do this by
maintaining a tree backed by an array (using the heap index math we
learned before), we can do these operations in log n
