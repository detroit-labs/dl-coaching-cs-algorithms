<aside class="notes">
<p>
In BFS, we will always be discovering new vertices or finding edges
that go to a vertex that we have already discovered but not yet
fully explored. If the vertex were already explored, we would have
already discovered the edge in question, so a newly discovered edge
cannot go back to an ancestor that is already in the discovery tree.
</p>

</aside>
<p>
Prove that in a breadth-first search of an undirected graph G, every
edge in G is either a tree edge or a cross edge. A cross edge
\((x,y)\) is an edge where \(x\) is neither an ancestor nor a
descendant of \(y\).

<h2 id="orgb0cf98c">Depth-First Search</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Perhaps the simplest way to think of a depth-first search is that
it is a breadth-first search that uses a stack instead of a
queue. Like breadth-first search, it intends to visit every vertex
and every edge in a graph in a systematic way. However, the order of
discovery will be very different, since we want to go as deep as
possible instead of as broadly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Generally, breadth-first search creates a relatively balanced
discovery tree, while depth-first search creates a relatively flat
discovery tree.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, this can be implemented recursively. To do this, we
can use the system's call stack instead of a stack data structure.

<h3 id="org66ece5c">DFS Order</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The important part about DFS is the order in which we discover the
vertices. In the DFS, we assign a direction to each edge from the
vertex which discovers it, so as not to backtrack to already
discovered edges.
</p>

<p>
Some edges will be edges we come across in our discovery tree and
others will be found but not involved in the discovery of new
vertices. All of the edges that do not point to a new vertex will
therefore point back to an ancestor.

<p>
In any particular DFS or BFS of a directed or undirected graph,
each edge gets classified as one of the above.

<li>A Tree Edge</li>
<li>A Back Edge to an ancestor</li>
<li>A Forward Edge to a descendant</li>
<li>A Cross Edge to a different node</li>

<h3 id="orgced57e2">Trees and Back Only</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
DFS defines specific ordering to the edges of the graph. In a DFS
of an undirected graph, every edge must be either a tree edge
discovering a new vertex, or a back edge. This is because any
undiscovered edge from a vertex being explored must either point to
a new vertex or to an ancestor. A edge incident to a vertex higher
up in the tree should have already been discovered when exploring
its descendant. Likewise, a cross edge would have been classified
as a tree edge before discovering the edges coming from the ancestors.

<h3 id="orgceb4109">Finding Cycles</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Back edges play an important role in the discovery of cycles. Any
back edge from some vertex inherently creates a cycle with the
path in the tree going from the vertex we are discovering to the
ancestor.
</p>

<p>
If we discover a vertex that is already discovered, that is, an
ancestor, then there is a cycle involving the points leading to the
vertex from the vertex the back edge points to, as well as the back
edge itself.

<h3 id="org2460437">Articulation Vertices</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
An articulation vertex is a vertex of a connected graph whose
deletion disconnects the graph. If you were a security specialist
and needed to prevent hackers from breaking in to the nuclear
facility's computers, which machine in the network would you take
offline?
</p>

<p>
Connectivity is an important concern in the design of networks.
</p>

<p>
We can find articulation vertices in O(n(n+m)) time by deleting
each vertex and doing a DFS on the remaining graph to see if it is
still connected.
</p>

<p>
Articulation edges have a similar property of connecting what would
otherwise be separate connected components that will not be
connected without the edge. These can be found similarly to
articulation vertices but by deleting edges instead in O(m(n+m))
time.

<h3 id="org2cb8fbe">Faster Articulation Vertices</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
In a DFS discovery tree, a vertex (not the root) is an
articulation vertex if it is not a leaf and some subtree of it has
no back edge incident to an ancestor of it. By taking this in to
account and keeping track of the oldest ancestor we have at a given
time, we can find the articulation vertices during a single DFS in
O(n+m) time. This is apparent only because of the ordered nature of
the DFS.

<h2 id="org6727c62">Topological Sorting</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So far we've been looking at problems as they relate to undirected
graphs. Let's hop over to another important algorithm for graphs,
which is topological sorting.
</p>

<p>
An directed, acyclic graph has no directed cycles.
</p>

<p>
A topological sorting of a graph is an ordering on the vertices so
that all the edges go from left to right (or one side to the
other). This is probably the most important problem involving DAGs.
</p>

<p>
All DAGs (and only DAGs) have at least one topological sort. They
must be orderable to both connected and acyclic.
</p>

<h3 id="orgbe9e3d7">What are DAGs for?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Topological sorting is useful in scheduling jobs in a proper
sequence. More generally we can use topological sorting to order
things based on given precidence constraints.
</p>

<p>
Course prerequisites for classes are a DAG. Recipes are a DAG. The
order that we might get dressed in the morning can be modeled as a DAG.
What else are DAGs?

<h3 id="org0c6a472">Topological Sort and DFS</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A directed graph is a DAG if no back edges are discovered during a
depth-first search. Reversing the order in which the vertices are
labeled "processed" gives one possible topological sort of a
DAG. Why is this?
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Consider a directed edge (x,y) as we explore it while discovering x:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If y is currently undiscovered, we start a DFS on y before coming
back to continue on x. y will be marked "completed" before x, and
x will appear before y in topological sort.</li>
<li>If y is discovered but not completed, (x,y) is a back edge, so
this is not a DAG.</li>
<li>If y is completed, then it will have already been labeled and x
still appears before it in topological sort.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="orgfad3a9d">Strongly Connected Components</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path
between any two given vertices.
</p>

<p>
A strongly connected component is a maximal subset of the graph such
that the subset behaves like a strongly connected graph of its own.
</p>

<p>
No single vertex can be part of two strongly connected components,
otherwise the two components would be a single component. Therefore,
strongly connected component partition the graph into subsections.

Kosaraju's Algorithm is an elegant, recursive algorithm that uses
depth-first search to find the connected components of a graph.

<li><p>
For each vertex u of the graph do Visit(u), where Visit(u) is
the recursive subroutine:

<p>
If u is unvisited then:

<p>
Mark u as visited.
For each out-neighbour v of u, do Visit(v).
Prepend u to L.

Otherwise do nothing.

For each element u of L in order, do Assign(u,u) where
Assign(u,root) is the recursive subroutine:

<p>
If u has not been assigned to a component then:

Assign u as belonging to the component whose root is root.
For each in-neighbour v of u, do Assign(v,root).
